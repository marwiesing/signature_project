# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide: Stuck PostgreSQL Table Queries in Kubernetes

## 🧩 Problem

You execute a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM chatbot_schema.app_user;
```

And it **hangs** or never returns. You might also see:

* No result
* `^C` (cancel request sent)
* The pod seems responsive, but the query doesn't complete

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. 🔍 Enter the PostgreSQL Pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it <postgres-pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/bash
```

Example:

```bash
kubectl exec -it postgres-768d947f59-qrpv5 -n chatbot -- /bin/bash
```

### 2. 🔑 Access PostgreSQL Shell

```bash
psql -U chatbot_user chatbot_db
```

---

### 3. 🔎 Check for Long-Running Transactions

Run:

```sql
SELECT pid, query, state, wait_event_type, wait_event, backend_start
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'chatbot_db';
```

#### Look for:

* `state = 'idle in transaction'`
* `wait_event = 'ClientRead'`
* Queries like: `SELECT * FROM chatbot_schema.app_user WHERE ...`

---

### 4. 💀 Terminate Stale Backends

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'chatbot_db'
  AND state = 'idle in transaction';
```

✔️ This will *release locks* and let your query proceed normally.

---

### 5. ✅ Rerun Your Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM chatbot_schema.app_user LIMIT 10;
```

It should now return instantly.

## 🧠 Root Cause

This happens when an application (e.g., Flask/SQLAlchemy) **starts a transaction but never finishes it** — no `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

These "zombie transactions" hold locks and block access to the table.

---

## 🛡️ Prevent This in the Future

### 🔧 In PostgreSQL:

Set a timeout for idle transactions:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '60s';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

### 🔧 In Flask SQLAlchemy:

Ensure every session:

* Commits after use:

  ```python
  db.session.commit()
  ```
* Or rolls back on error:

  ```python
  db.session.rollback()
  ```

Optionally use context managers:

```python
with db.session.begin():
    # queries here
```

---

## 🧪 Optional: Detect Locked Tables

Run this to see all locks and waiters:

```sql
SELECT l.relation::regclass, l.mode, a.pid, a.query
FROM pg_locks l
JOIN pg_stat_activity a ON l.pid = a.pid
WHERE NOT l.granted;
```

## 📌 Quick Summary

| Action                   | Command                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enter PostgreSQL pod     | `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- /bin/bash`                          |
| Open DB shell            | `psql -U chatbot_user chatbot_db`                              |
| Show active sessions     | `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'chatbot_db';` |
| Kill idle transactions   | `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) ...`                         |
| Rerun your blocked query | `SELECT * FROM ... LIMIT 10;`                                  |

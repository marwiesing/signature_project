## 🔒 Your Next Feature Roadmap

### ✅ Priority Goals

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **RBAC** | Define what each user *can* do (Admin vs. User) |
| **OAuth login** | Let users sign in with Google, GitLab, etc. |
| **Admin Dashboard** | See stats like user count, activity, LLM usage |
| (Optional) **2FA** | Add a second layer of protection for accounts |

---

## 🧠 About 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

### ✅ What is it?

2FA = something you know (**password**) + something you have (**phone app**)

Most common is **TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password)** — e.g., scan a QR code into Google Authenticator or Authy.

---

### 😎 How It Works (Backend)

You store a **secret** per user (e.g., using `pyotp`), and show a **QR code** the user can scan. Every 30 seconds, the authenticator app generates a code based on the secret.

Your Flask app then:
1. Validates login (username + password)
2. If user has 2FA enabled, asks for 6-digit code
3. Verifies the code matches what `pyotp` generates for the secret

---

### 🧩 Is It Hard to Implement?

**Surprisingly, no.** You can implement **TOTP 2FA** in Flask with:

- ✅ `pyotp` (generates/validates tokens)
- ✅ `qrcode` or `qrcode[pil]` (generate QR code)
- ✅ Optional: `Flask-Login` + `Flask-WTF` for session and form handling

### ✅ Example in Flask:

```python
import pyotp
import qrcode
from io import BytesIO
from flask import send_file

@app.route('/2fa/enable')
def enable_2fa():
    user = get_current_user()
    secret = pyotp.random_base32()
    user.totp_secret = secret
    db.session.commit()

    uri = pyotp.totp.TOTP(secret).provisioning_uri(name=user.email, issuer_name="SignatureProject")
    qr = qrcode.make(uri)
    buf = BytesIO()
    qr.save(buf)
    buf.seek(0)

    return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/png')
```

Then on login, you'd do:

```python
totp = pyotp.TOTP(user.totp_secret)
if totp.verify(submitted_code):
    # Login successful
```

### 🔐 Should You Do 2FA Now?

If you're only using OAuth (Google/GitLab login), **you don't need to build 2FA** — because Google already handles it.

But if you're supporting **email + password logins**, 2FA is a great upgrade — and not as hard as it looks.

---

## ✅ Recommendations for You

| Step | Priority |
|------|----------|
| 🔐 Add RBAC to Flask | ✅ Do now |
| 🔑 Add OAuth login (Google preferred) | ✅ Do now |
| 📊 Build Admin Dashboard | ✅ Do now |
| 🧩 Add 2FA (TOTP-based) | 🔜 Optional — easier than expected |

---

Would you like a scaffold for:
- [ ] **Flask RBAC roles with decorators**?
- [ ] **Google OAuth login with Flask-Dance or Flask-OAuthlib?**
- [ ] **Simple QR-code-based 2FA setup with `pyotp` + `qrcode`?**


---

## **Quick Check Summary** — Martin, your implementation is **absolutely spot on**. Let’s confirm everything in a checklist format for clarity:

---

## ✅ `auth.py`

### 🔐 Login
- [x] Supports username **or** email for login
- [x] Joins `user_role` and `role` tables
- [x] Loads role name into `session["role"]`

```python
session["role"] = user_row[3]  # 'Admin' or 'User'
```

✅ Perfect.

---

### 📝 Registration
- [x] Validates and sanitizes email + username
- [x] Checks for duplicates
- [x] Inserts into `app_user`
- [x] Assigns default role (`idrole = 2`, which is `'User'`)
- [x] Creates initial "Welcome Chat"

```python
db.execute_query("""
    INSERT INTO chatbot_schema.user_role (idappuser, idrole)
    VALUES (%s, %s);
""", (user_id, 2))
```

✅ Clean, modular, and ready for later admin promotion.

---

## ✅ `auth_utils.py`

- [x] Defines a `require_role(role)` decorator
- [x] Redirects with a flash message if the user doesn't have the required role

✅ Solid, secure, and reusable.

---

## ✅ `admin.py`

- [x] Route protected with `@require_role("Admin")`
- [x] Loads user and chat stats
- [x] Renders clean admin template

✅ Future-ready for extending with:
- Role management
- LLM usage stats
- Logs / error tracking

---

## ✅ `admin.html`

- [x] Extends your base layout
- [x] Clean HTML with user/chat counts
- [x] Mentions "Future" roadmap clearly

✅ Excellent starting point for further admin tools.

---

## 🚀 You're Ready for Phase 3 Features:

Now that RBAC is **fully functional**, your next options are:

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| 🔐 **Google OAuth login** | ✅ Start next | Use `email` to map identity; assign "User" role |
| 🎛️ **User Management UI** | Optional now | Allow Admin to promote/demote roles |
| 🧠 **Model usage tracking** | Optional later | Count per-user LLM queries, errors |
| 🔐 **2FA (TOTP)** | Optional | Layer for password logins only

---

Let me know if you want to:
- Scaffold the **Google OAuth login** flow using Flask-Dance or Flask-OAuthlib
- Add a table to the admin dashboard to **list all users with their roles**
- Promote a user from `"User"` → `"Admin"` via the UI

Everything you're doing is 🔐 secure, 💡 modular, and 💪 production-level. Bravo!
